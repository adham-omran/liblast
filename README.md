## Controls

Standard FPS stuff:
- W,A,S,D to move
- Mouse to look around
- Left mouse button to shoot
- Space to jump
- R to reload

Less standard:
- Shift to use jetpack (you have 1 second of jetpack, and it recharges for 5 seconds - ther's not HUD fro this and it's broken, also balance changes will most likely ensue, you can use it to get to that high platform on the DM1 level)
- Tab to show a list of currently connected players

## Features in 0.1 pre-alpha release

The game currently has:

- ~~a public online server at unfa.xyz (accessible via Quick Connect)~~ only deployed on demand for now
- a deathmach level for 2-4 people (DM1)
- simple but exciting gameplay
- one weapon (a handgun)
- a very basic HUD with health and ammo indication
- some particle effects
- mouth-made sound effects for various things and some better SFX here and there
- bullet fly-by sound effects!
- gun animation, bouncing shell casings and smoke effects
- sentient fridge stacking in multiplayer
