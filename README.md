## Rewrite Status

The game is currently scheduled to be rewritten from scratch in Godot 4 once the first Alpha releasae is there.
The current version of the game has served well as a prototype and a testbed to help us figure out what we want to do. We've also learned some important lessons on our mistakes.
We wanted to take advantage of the improvement performance, features and workflow of Godot 4 and since the GDScript syntax is changing significantly - we've decided we'll take this opportunity to rebuild the game from scratch and improve our design.

Hence - if you'd like to contribute to the project, please get in touch first, as things are very much in flux right now, and we'd hate to have any effort wasted!

## Get in touch

## Controls

Standard FPS stuff:
- W,A,S,D to move
- Mouse to look around
- Left mouse button to shoot
- Space to jump
- R to reload

Less standard:
- Shift to use jetpack (you have 1 second of jetpack, and it recharges for 5 seconds - ther's not HUD fro this and it's broken, also balance changes will most likely ensue, you can use it to get to that high platform on the DM1 level)
- Tab to show a list of currently connected players

## Features in 0.1 pre-alpha release

The game currently has:

- ~~a public online server at unfa.xyz (accessible via Quick Connect)~~ only deployed on demand for now
- a deathmach level for 2-4 people (DM1)
- simple but exciting gameplay
- one weapon (a handgun)
- a very basic HUD with health and ammo indication
- some particle effects
- mouth-made sound effects for various things and some better SFX here and there
- bullet fly-by sound effects!
- gun animation, bouncing shell casings and smoke effects
- sentient fridge stacking in multiplayer

# What's with the name?

`Libre` + `Blast` = `Liblast`
No, it's not a library. Sorry if it's confusing.
