## Controls

Standard FPS stuff:
- W,A,S,D to move
- Mouse to look around
- Left mouse button to shoot
- Space to jump
- R to reload

Less standard:
- Shift to use jetpack (you have 1 second of jetpack, and it recharges for 5 seconds - ther's not HUD fro this and it's broken, also balance changes will most likely ensue, you can use it to get to that high platform on the DM1 level)

## Features in 0.1 pre-alpha release

The game currently has:

- ~~a public online server at unfa.xyz (accessible via Quick Connect)~~ only deployed on demand for now

- a single test level designed for 2-4 pleayer deathmatch
- particle effects
- mouth-made sound effects for various things
- bullet fly-by sound effects!
- gun animation, bouncing shell casings and smoke effects

- ~~a random rigidbody cube that's not working correctly
